# management-tips
A public repository for collecting book suggestions, quotes, tips and anything else that could help me grow as a manager. Pull requests are welcome!

As a technical leader you need to be able to wear many hats, often at once, to be able to do your job succesfully. The sections below are divided into different subjects one may need to tackle and then within each subject list a number of links / books / advice that can help provide some insight. 


### managing yourself


### managing your team

As a manager you are only as sucessful as your team.

#### Motivation

Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us) [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1) 

> "Carrots & Sticks are so last Century. Drive says for 21st century work, we need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery and purpose."

> The idea that in creative teams the only way to motivate people is through appealing to their internal motivation, through such means as establishing a sense of higher purpose "this product will make the world better", personal mastery "if you do this, you would be expert in X" or a sense of personal autonomy and control over ones destiny "here is the vision, but you decide how to get there". On the other hand, traditional coercive / external motivational techniques such as "do this or else" and "finish this by that date, and you will get a bonus" no longer work, and often would prove counter productive by destroying the internal motivation.

> This is an excelent video that summarizes the content of that book in 5 minutes: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdzHgN7_Hs8)


How to Win Friends & Influence People [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034/ref=pd_sim_14_2) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)

> It's really amazing to me how well this book has held up, considering the original was published all the way back in 1936. This is way before computers were even invented, and yet most of the advice still applies to almost daily situation. One could argue that most of the business / management advice being created today is really just rehashing of the same material that was created by Dale Carnegie. Trying to summarize this would be sacrelgious so let's put it this way - as a manager, dealing with people is your number one job, and this is probably still the best book to cover that.


#### Team Chemistry

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team)
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership/dp/0787960756)

> I am not in love with the format so I would recommend just reading the wiki summary. With that said the 5 dysfunctions it present are super critical to be recognized and addressed to ensure a healthy and working team, rather than a bunch of colocated strangers. The critical items are:

  > Absence of trust - are people comfortable with sharing their mistakes and vulnerabilities with the group? Typically a result of a culture that emphasizes punishing for mistakes rather than viewing issues as opportunities to improve.
  
  > Fear of Conflict - the ultimate passive aggressive behavior, are people agreeing in words, but then not following through with actions? If that happens, you need to examine why people prefer not to engage in constructive conflict. Is it fear of reprecussions? Specific toxic individuals? Lack of conflict resolution skills? Disagreements becoming personal? Any number of things could cause this, and the important idea is to make sure to address all of these barriers to enable fearless discussion. Key phrase - it's not important who is right, as long as the right thing is done.
  
  > Lack of Commitment - sort of related to previous point, commitment in words but not in actions. 
  
  > Avoidance of accountability - both shifting the blame, as well as not holding peers to higher standards. 
  
  > Inattention to results - focusing on personal success / reputation / goals at the team's expense.


#### Metrics


**The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business**
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Habit)[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_1)

> This book isn't specific to software engineer, or even business / management, as it has a number of other applications including personal growth and so on. The critical piece that is relevant for us is best summarized here [How 'Keystone Habits' Transformed a Corporation](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-duhigg/the-power-of-habit_b_1304550.html) but if you want an even shorter version the idea is that team / company culture is created out of habits - which are essentially automatic responses to certain stimuli and situations. What do you do when ticket is created, how do you respond to feature request, how do you handle bug reports - those are all automatic responses that vary between teams and companies but form together to create the working culture. The argument is that some of these habits could be toxic and harmful, such as the all-too-common QA / developers ping pong game, but the good news is that it's possible to identify one (or small number) of "keystone habits", and by directly working to change those, it's possible to change the entire culture. The classic example is Alcoa and how by focusing the entire company on worker safety they were able to build a culture of innovation, cost controls, accountability and so on. 


**Universal Scalability Law**

> [Explanation as applied to systems](http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html)

> [USL for organizations](http://blog.acolyer.org/2015/04/29/applying-the-universal-scalability-law-to-organisations/)

> It’s really important you learn to **delegate effectively** and to **choose carefully** the things that you do get involved in.

> As the organisation grows, strive to keep **the number of stakeholders** that need to be involved in any decision down to a **minimum**

> You need to keep a **strict handle** on how many things you’re involved in **concurrently;** your natural human instinct to be helpful to everyone who asks you to do something for them, or to contribute to their project, actually isn’t helpful at all. (Nor is your desire to control / influence everything if you’re wired that way).

> Working at or **close to 100% utilization** will slow to a **crawl** everything that depends on you.

### agile / lean / project management

http://www.agilemanifesto.org/

[Lean Software Development](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Software-Development-Agile-Toolkit/dp/0321150783/ref=sr_1_1)

[Agile Leader](http://blog.crisp.se/2015/11/10/henrikkniberg/what-is-an-agile-leader)

What does an Agile Leader do?

> What does winning look like? Vision/Mission.
  
> What’s the plan? Strategy and tactics.
  
> What’s the score? Progress, status, feedback loops
  
> What is preventing us from winning? Continous improvement, people, teams, strategy, tactics.


Agile leader possible focus areas

> **Vision/mission**. Ensure the the work being done has a clear purpose, clear hypotheses, clear boundaries/scope (“what are we NOT doing”), and clear success metrics based on business impact rather than deliveries. Ensure this is crystal clear to everyone involved, teams as well as customers and other stakeholders.

> **Iterative and incremental delivery**. Ensure that the work is split into sub-deliveries, to enable iterative and incremental delivery rather than big bang.  Avoid large projects whenever possible, instead try to split the work into a series of smaller projects whenever feasible.

> **Adaptive planning**. Ensure that plans are created and communicated to everyone involved. Ensure the plans are adaptive rather than predictive, and updated as we learn. Ensure that deadlines are communicated and forecasts created as necessary, and updated based on empirical data as the work progresses. Make sure any constraints (date or scope) are clear to everyone.

> **Feedback**.  Ensure a short feedback loop with tight and frequent communication between teams and customers. Collaborative planning, demos, etc. Ensure that hypotheses and assumptions are field-tested early and that learning happens continuously. Ensure that progress is measured based on actual deliveries and feedback and business impact, not by compliance to plan.

> **Continuous improvement and knowledge sharing**. Ensuring that learning and improvement happens continuously as the work progresses (not just at the end), and that key learnings are shared within the teams as well as across different parts of the organization.

> **Focus and alignment**. Ensure that participants are focused and dedicated (not multitasking), and aligned with the same list of priorities. Bash silos. Ensure that people are focusing on achieving the highest possible business impact with the lowest possible effort and output (working smart is more important than working hard).

> **Impediment removal**. Ensure that waste and impediments are visualized, prioritized, and systematically removed. Encourage teams to own and solve their own impediments whenever possible. Collaborate with other managers and take ownership of impediments that are escalated.

> **Decision enablement**. Ensure that decisions are made in a just-in-time manner and by the people who have the best insight into the matter, decentralized whenever possible. Ensure that nobody (including you) becomes a decision bottleneck. Minimize the number of decisions that have to be made by you.

> **Visualize status and progress**. Ensure that everyone can see the “big picture” – dashboards and such showing where we are going and why, where we are now, impediments, etc. Keep it at a high level, leave the details to the teams.

> **Flow**. Optimize for end-to-end flow of value, not resource utilization. Look for bottlenecks and queues, and apply systems thinking and lean principles to streamline the delivery of business value.

> **Self-organization and autonomy**. Make the goal and current situation clear so that people can think and act autonomously, with no need for you to tell them what to do.  Ensure people are given problems to solve rather than tasks to execute. Harness the collective intelligence of the group, rather than trying to be a mastermind yourself.
Staffing and capacity planning. Work with managers to ensure that the right people and teams are available at the right time to maximize the velocity and chance of success.

> **Budgets and estimates**. Ensure that any budget and contractual constraints are known and managed.  Ensure that estimates are done by the team closest to the work at hand, kept at a high level, and adjusted when necessary. Ensure that estimates are treated as estimates, not promises. Make costs transparent.

> **Dependencies**. Ensure that cross-team and cross-company dependencies are visualized and managed effectively, and that teams aren’t blocked waiting for each other.

> **Cross-functional collaboration**. Use techniques such as co-location and cross-functional communication channels to reduce siloing and suboptimization.

> **Communication**. Create an environment that facilitates high bandwidth face-to-face communication and minimizes the need for unnecessary documents, emails, and other low-bandwidth communication. Documents should be used to support communication, not replace it.

> **Fast failure**. Create a context where small failures can happen early and often, thereby reducing the risk of a big failure at the end.



### Software Engineering 

http://www.extremeprogramming.org/

The Cathedral and the Bazaar [Online](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)

> The classic on why open source will (has?) win. Even if you ignore the open source parts, it has lots of useful information on right ways to do software engineering, that were later adopted into various agile / lean methods. The wikipedia has a nice summary but here are some of the more important ones in my mind 

  > "Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)."
  
  > "Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow."
  
  > "Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging"
  
  > "Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers"
  
  > "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone"
  
  > "Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around"
  
  > "Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong"
  
  > "Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)"
  
  > "A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets."
  
C2 [Website](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatterns) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb)

> The original wiki that was developed to exchange ideas around software development and design patterns back in 1994. Still online amazingly enough. A lot of the content is still valid though at this point there are likely better resources for a lot of this stuff. Despite that I still find myself checking it once in a while.

### Product Management

As an engineering leader, you don't need to be a product manager, but you have to understand the key concepts and ideas, so you can collaborate with the product team and ensure that you are not only building the product right way, but also that you are building the right product.

The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup)

> One of those classics that everyone talks about but I don't think anyone has actually read. At least I haven't :)

> Popularized ideas around MVP, A/B testing, Pivot, Build-Measure-Learn and so on. If you have no idea what I am talking about go read at least the wikipedia summary right now.

### Gurus

+ [Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie)

> The original guru of the soft skills, a lot of his ideas are battle tested and time proven. To be fair, I don't think it's humanly possible to follow the entirety of his advice, but as long as you try to apply it as much as possible, you should be fine.

+ [Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Peters)

> The original business guru, one of the authors of the bestselling [In Search Of Excellence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Excellence) book back in 1982, which I cover in more detail above. Extremely pragmatic, straight to a point he has lots of great advice that can be used on any level, even though typically his target audience is the executives. His public speaking style and the unique decks are a source of inspiration, so I would recommend searching for some of his publicly available videos. He doesn't have anything specific for software, but if you are just graduating to leadership role, you could do much worse than focusing on just him and Carnegie. Everything else is an extra.

### Quick Hacks

+ Learn to shut up and hold an uncomfortable pause - when doing one-on-ones, or team meetings where you are asking for feedback / suggestions / concerns etc... You can get a lot just by holding and waiting for other person to fill in the silence, arguably more than what you would get by asking questions.
+ Related to the above, if in a group conversation you feel that everybody is talking to you instead of having an actual discussion, try avoiding eye contact and not responding and see what happens. Does wonders to get the team to actually talk to each other.
+ If people are bringing laptops and staring into them during the meetings - pick someone with laptop at random and ask them to take notes. Do it 3 times and you can be sure no one will bring laptop again. 
  + Of course, you should also try to understand why people were prefering to stare into the laptop in the first place.
+ [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) - useful for getting to the root issue, often even when the person you are talking to is not even aware of it. Try it and you may learn something surprising.


### Bits and Ends

When all else fails...

+ [The classic](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law)
+ [The bike shed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality)
+ [The work expansion law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)

  > Unfortunately often perverted to mean "if we set tighter deadlines, the project will finish faster"

+ [For when you feel the office politics are driving you crazy](http://workplace.stackexchange.com/)

  > As they say in that famous joke, at least you are not [testing rectal thermometers](http://www.snopes.com/humor/jokes/thermometer.asp)
  
  > Seriously though, this is a good guide of what NOT to do. Sometimes it's better to learn from other people's mistakes.
