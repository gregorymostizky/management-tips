As a technical leader you need to be able to wear many hats, often at once, to be able to do your job succesfully. The sections below are divided into different subjects one may need to tackle and then within each subject list a number of links / books / advice that can help provide some insight.

As a manager you are only as sucessful as your team.

#### Motivation

Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us) [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1) 

> "Carrots & Sticks are so last Century. Drive says for 21st century work, we need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery and purpose."

> The idea that in creative teams the only way to motivate people is through appealing to their internal motivation, through such means as establishing a sense of higher purpose "this product will make the world better", personal mastery "if you do this, you would be expert in X" or a sense of personal autonomy and control over ones destiny "here is the vision, but you decide how to get there". On the other hand, traditional coercive / external motivational techniques such as "do this or else" and "finish this by that date, and you will get a bonus" no longer work, and often would prove counter productive by destroying the internal motivation.
