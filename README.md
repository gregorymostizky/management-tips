# management-tips
A public repository for collecting book suggestions, quotes, tips and anything else that could help me grow as a manager. Pull requests are welcome!

As a technical leader you need to be able to wear many hats, often at once, to be able to do your job succesfully. The sections below are divided into different subjects one may need to tackle and then within each subject list a number of links / books / advice that can help provide some insight. 


# managing yourself


# managing your team

As a manager you are only as sucessful as your team.

#### Motivation

Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us) [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1) 

> "Carrots & Sticks are so last Century. Drive says for 21st century work, we need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery and purpose."

> The idea that in creative teams the only way to motivate people is through appealing to their internal motivation, through such means as establishing a sense of higher purpose "this product will make the world better", personal mastery "if you do this, you would be expert in X" or a sense of personal autonomy and control over ones destiny "here is the vision, but you decide how to get there". On the other hand, traditional coercive / external motivational techniques such as "do this or else" and "finish this by that date, and you will get a bonus" no longer work, and often would prove counter productive by destroying the internal motivation.



#### Team Chemistry

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

> I am not in love with the format so I would recommend just reading the wiki summary. With that said the 5 dysfunctions it present are super critical to be recognized and addressed to ensure a healthy and working team, rather than a bunch of colocated strangers. The critical items are:

  > Absence of trust - are people comfortable with sharing their mistakes and vulnerabilities with the group? Typically a result of a culture that emphasizes punishing for mistakes rather than viewing issues as opportunities to improve.
  
  > Fear of Conflict - the ultimate passive aggressive behavior, are people agreeing in words, but then not following through with actions? If that happens, you need to examine why people prefer not to engage in constructive conflict. Is it fear of reprecussions? Specific toxic individuals? Lack of conflict resolution skills? Disagreements becoming personal? Any number of things could cause this, and the important idea is to make sure to address all of these barriers to enable fearless discussion. Key phrase - it's not important who is right, as long as the right thing is done.
  
  > Lack of Commitment - sort of related to previous point, commitment in words but not in actions. 
  
  > Avoidance of accountability - both shifting the blame, as well as not holding peers to higher standards. 
  
  > Inattention to results - focusing on personal success / reputation / goals at the team's expense.
